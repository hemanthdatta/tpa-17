# KNN-Based Zero-Shot Classification

## Overview

This document describes the **KNN-based zero-shot classification** approach implemented as an alternative to the traditional text-template based method. This approach is particularly well-suited for low-data regime scenarios.

---

## Motivation

### Traditional Zero-Shot (Text-Based)

The standard CLIP zero-shot approach:
1. Creates text embeddings from class names using templates (e.g., "a photo of {class}")
2. Computes similarity between test image embeddings and text embeddings
3. Classifies based on highest similarity

**Limitations:**
- Requires good text descriptions/templates
- Templates may not capture visual nuances
- Performance depends on template quality
- Domain-specific terminology may not align with pre-training

### KNN-Based Zero-Shot

Our KNN approach:
1. Extracts visual features from a small **support set** (training images)
2. Uses K-Nearest Neighbors in the feature space
3. Classifies test images based on visual similarity to support examples

**Advantages:**
- ✅ No need for text templates or descriptions
- ✅ Learns from actual visual examples in the target domain
- ✅ Better captures fine-grained visual differences
- ✅ More suitable for specialized domains (plant diseases)
- ✅ Leverages the limited labeled data effectively

## How It Works

### Step 1: Feature Extraction
```python
# Extract features from support set (train images)
support_features, support_labels = extract_features(train_loader)

# Extract features from query set (test images)
query_features, query_labels = extract_features(test_loader)
```

All features are **L2-normalized** to enable cosine similarity.

### Step 2: KNN Classification
```python
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(
    n_neighbors=k,           # Default: 5
    metric='cosine',         # Cosine similarity
    weights='distance',      # Weight by inverse distance
    algorithm='brute'        # Exact nearest neighbors
)

knn.fit(support_features, support_labels)
predictions = knn.predict(query_features)
```

### Step 3: Prediction
For each test image:
1. Find k nearest neighbors in the support set
2. Weight neighbors by inverse distance
3. Vote (weighted) to determine class

## Usage

### Command Line

```bash
# Run KNN zero-shot with default k=5
python main.py --knn-zero-shot

# Run KNN zero-shot with k=10
python main.py --knn-zero-shot --k-neighbors 10

# Run both text-based and KNN zero-shot
python main.py --zero-shot --knn-zero-shot

# Standalone script
python zero_shot_knn.py --k 5
```

### Python API

```python
from zero_shot_knn import KNNZeroShotClassifier, run_knn_zero_shot_evaluation

# Quick evaluation
results = run_knn_zero_shot_evaluation(k_neighbors=5)

# Custom usage
classifier = KNNZeroShotClassifier(k_neighbors=7)
classifier.fit_knn(train_loader)
accuracy, preds, labels = classifier.evaluate_knn(test_loader)
```

## Hyperparameters

### Number of Neighbors (k)

| k | Behavior | Best For |
|---|----------|----------|
| 1 | Nearest neighbor only | High-quality features, clear boundaries |
| 3-5 | Small neighborhood | **Default, balanced** |
| 7-10 | Medium neighborhood | Noisy features, gradual boundaries |
| 15+ | Large neighborhood | Very noisy data, risk of oversmoothing |

**Recommendation**: Start with k=5, tune based on validation accuracy.

### Distance Metric

- **Cosine** (default): Measures angle between vectors, invariant to magnitude
  - Best for normalized embeddings
  - Standard for vision models

- **Euclidean**: L2 distance
  - Sensitive to feature scale
  - Less common for CLIP features

- **Manhattan**: L1 distance
  - Robust to outliers
  - Rarely used for vision

### Weighting Scheme

- **Distance-weighted** (default): Closer neighbors have more influence
  - Better for varying neighbor distances
  - Recommended for most cases

- **Uniform**: All neighbors have equal vote
  - Simpler, faster
  - Can work well with optimal k

## Expected Performance

### Low-Data Regime (50 samples/class)

| Method | Expected Test Accuracy | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------------------------|------|------|
| **Text Zero-Shot** | 40-60% | No training data needed | Template-dependent, domain gap |
| **KNN Zero-Shot (k=5)** | 60-75% | Uses visual examples | Requires support set |
| **Linear Probe** | 75-85% | Trained classifier | More parameters |

### Why KNN Outperforms Text-Based?

1. **Domain Adaptation**: Uses actual examples from PlantVillage, not web-scale text
2. **Visual Similarity**: Captures fine-grained disease patterns better than text
3. **No Template Engineering**: Avoids the challenge of writing good prompts
4. **Feature Quality**: CLIP features are strong for visual similarity

---

## Configuration

Edit `config.py` for dataset settings:

```python
# Support set size (affects KNN accuracy)
SAMPLES_PER_CLASS = 50  # More samples = better KNN

# Model selection (affects feature quality)
CLIP_MODEL = "ViT-B-32"  # Larger models = better features
```

Command-line override:

```bash
python main.py --knn-zero-shot --k-neighbors 7
```

---

## Implementation Details

### Feature Normalization

All features are L2-normalized:
```python
features = F.normalize(features, dim=-1)
```

This ensures cosine similarity is computed correctly.

### Memory Efficiency

Features are extracted once and cached:
- Support set: ~1,900 images × 512 dims = ~3.7 MB
- Test set: ~11,400 images × 512 dims = ~22 MB

Total memory: ~26 MB (very efficient!)

### Computational Complexity

- **Feature Extraction**: O(n) per image (parallelized on GPU)
- **KNN Search**: O(n × m × d) where:
  - n = test set size
  - m = support set size  
  - d = feature dimension

For our dataset:
- Test: 11,400 images
- Support: 1,900 images
- Features: 512 dims
- Total: ~11 billion operations (fast on CPU with sklearn)

## Comparison: Text vs. KNN Zero-Shot

| Aspect | Text-Based | KNN-Based |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Data Required** | None (just class names) | Small support set |
| **Template Dependency** | High | None |
| **Domain Adaptation** | Limited | Good |
| **Computation** | Fast (GPU) | Medium (CPU) |
| **Accuracy (Plant)** | 40-60% | 60-75% |
| **Accuracy (General)** | 65-75% | 50-70% |
| **Best For** | General domains, no labels | Specialized domains, few labels |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Low Accuracy

**Possible causes:**
1. k too small or too large
   - Try k=3, 5, 7, 10
2. Support set too small
   - Increase `SAMPLES_PER_CLASS` in config
3. Feature quality issues
   - Try larger model: `--model ViT-L-14`

### Memory Issues

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce batch size for feature extraction
2. Process in chunks (already implemented)
3. Use smaller model

### Slow Performance

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce support set size (fewer samples per class)
2. Use approximate KNN (LSH, Annoy) for very large datasets
3. Ensure using all CPU cores (n_jobs=-1)

## Advanced Usage

### Custom K Values

```python
from zero_shot_knn import KNNZeroShotClassifier

# Try different k values
for k in [3, 5, 7, 10]:
    classifier = KNNZeroShotClassifier(k_neighbors=k)
    classifier.fit_knn(train_loader)
    acc, _, _ = classifier.evaluate_knn(test_loader)
    print(f"k={k}: {acc:.2f}%")
```

### Confidence Scores

```python
# Get prediction confidence
acc, preds, labels, confidence = classifier.evaluate_with_confidence(test_loader)

# Find low-confidence predictions
low_conf_mask = confidence < 0.5
uncertain_samples = np.where(low_conf_mask)[0]
```

### Cross-Validation

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Extract all features first
features, labels = classifier.extract_features(full_loader)

# Cross-validate k
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
scores = cross_val_score(knn, features, labels, cv=5)
print(f"CV Accuracy: {scores.mean():.2f} ± {scores.std():.2f}")
```
