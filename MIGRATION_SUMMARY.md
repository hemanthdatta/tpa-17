# Migration Summary: Flowers102 → PlantVillage

## Overview

The project has been successfully migrated from the Oxford Flowers102 dataset to the **PlantVillage Crop Disease Dataset**. This change aligns the project with its core objectives: evaluating foundation model fine-tuning strategies in **low-data regimes** for **domain-specific tasks**.

---

## Key Changes

### 1. Dataset Configuration (`config.py`)

#### Before:
```python
DATASET_NAME = "flowers102"
FLOWER_CLASSES = [102 flower species]
TEXT_TEMPLATES = ["a photo of a {}.", "a beautiful {}.", ...]
```

#### After:
```python
DATASET_NAME = "plantvillage"
PLANT_DISEASE_CLASSES = [38 plant disease classes]
TEXT_TEMPLATES = [
    "a photo of a {}.",
    "a photo of a plant leaf with {}.",
    "a plant disease: {}.",
    ...
]

# New: Low-data regime configuration
SAMPLES_PER_CLASS = 50
USE_LIMITED_DATA = True
```

**Rationale**: 
- Specialized domain templates for agricultural context
- Low-data regime explicitly configured (50 samples/class)
- Aligns with project goal of limited labeled data scenarios

---

### 2. Data Loader (`data_loader.py`)

#### Major Changes:

1. **New Function**: `create_limited_dataset()`
   - Samples exactly N samples per class
   - Ensures balanced low-data regime
   - Reproducible with seed

2. **Dataset Loading**:
   - **Before**: `datasets.Flowers102()` (auto-download)
   - **After**: `datasets.ImageFolder()` (manual download required)
   - Reason: PlantVillage requires manual download from Kaggle

3. **Data Splits**:
   - **Before**: Pre-defined splits (1,020 train / 1,010 val / 6,149 test)
   - **After**: 70/15/15 split with limited training data
     - Train: ~1,900 images (50 per class × 38 classes)
     - Val: ~11,400 images (15% of full)
     - Test: ~11,400 images (15% of full)

4. **Augmentation**:
   - Added rotation (±15°) and color jitter for plant images
   - Helps with limited training data

#### Backward Compatibility:
```python
# Alias for compatibility
get_flowers_dataloaders = get_plantvillage_dataloaders
```

---

### 3. Updated All Training Scripts

Files updated:
- ✅ `zero_shot.py`
- ✅ `linear_probe.py`
- ✅ `full_finetuning.py`
- ✅ `adapter_finetuning.py`
- ✅ `main.py`

**Changes**:
1. Import `get_plantvillage_dataloaders` instead of `get_flowers_dataloaders`
2. Use `config.PLANT_DISEASE_CLASSES` instead of `config.FLOWER_CLASSES`
3. Updated docstrings and comments

---

### 4. Documentation Updates

#### New Files:
- **`DATASET_SETUP.md`**: Complete guide for downloading and setting up PlantVillage dataset
- **`MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md`**: This file

#### Updated Files:
- **`README.md`**: 
  - Complete rewrite focusing on low-data regime
  - Project goals and research questions
  - Expected performance metrics adjusted
  - PlantVillage-specific instructions

## Why PlantVillage?

### Alignment with Project Goals

| Project Requirement | How PlantVillage Addresses It |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Domain Shift** | Agricultural disease detection is distinct from web-scale pre-training data (ImageNet, LAION) |
| **Low-Data Regime** | 50 samples/class simulates realistic expert-labeled data scarcity |
| **Specialized Domain** | Plant pathology requires domain expertise, unlike general objects |
| **Practical Application** | Real-world impact in agriculture and food security |
| **Sufficient Complexity** | 38 classes provide good evaluation scope |

### Dataset Statistics

| Metric | Flowers102 | PlantVillage (Limited) |
|--------|------------|------------------------|
| **Classes** | 102 | 38 |
| **Training Samples** | 1,020 | ~1,900 (50/class) |
| **Domain** | General (flowers) | Specialized (agriculture) |
| **Download** | Automatic | Manual (Kaggle) |
| **Challenge** | Fine-grained recognition | Disease classification + domain shift |

---

## Expected Performance Changes

### Flowers102 (Previous)

| Method | Expected Accuracy |
|--------|-------------------|
| Zero-Shot | 65-75% |
| Linear Probe | 85-92% |
| LoRA | 88-93% |
| Full Fine-tune | 90-95% |

### PlantVillage (Current - Low Data Regime)

| Method | Expected Accuracy | Reason for Change |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Zero-Shot | 40-60% ⬇️ | Larger domain gap (web → agriculture) |
| Linear Probe | 75-85% ⬇️ | Less training data, but strong features |
| LoRA | 80-88% ⬇️ | Limited data + domain adaptation |
| Full Fine-tune | 85-92% ⬇️ | Risk of overfitting with limited data |

**Key Insight**: Lower accuracy is **expected and desirable** for this project, as it demonstrates:
1. The challenge of domain shift
2. The importance of efficient fine-tuning in low-data scenarios
3. The value of parameter-efficient methods (LoRA, BitFit) over full fine-tuning

---

## How to Use

### Quick Start

1. **Download Dataset**:
   ```bash
   # See DATASET_SETUP.md for detailed instructions
   # Download from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease
   # Extract to: ./data/plantvillage/PlantVillage/
   ```

2. **Verify Setup**:
   ```bash
   python data_loader.py
   ```
   Should print:
   ```
   LOW-DATA REGIME ENABLED: 50 samples per class
   Total classes: 38
   Train: ~1900 images
   Val: ~11400 images
   Test: ~11400 images
   ```

3. **Run Experiments**:
   ```bash
   python main.py --all
   ```

### Adjusting Data Regime

Edit `config.py`:

```python
# Extreme low-data (challenging)
SAMPLES_PER_CLASS = 20

# Standard low-data (current)
SAMPLES_PER_CLASS = 50

# Moderate low-data
SAMPLES_PER_CLASS = 100

# Full dataset (not recommended for this project)
USE_LIMITED_DATA = False
```

---

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Reproducibility
- Fixed random seed (42) for dataset sampling
- Deterministic train/val/test splits
- Consistent preprocessing

### 2. Efficiency
- Subset creation before DataLoader (memory efficient)
- Separate transforms for train vs. val/test
- Pin memory for GPU training

### 3. Flexibility
- Configurable samples per class
- Easy to disable limited data mode
- Compatible with existing code structure

---

## Backward Compatibility

While the dataset has changed, the API remains similar:

```python
# Old code (still works due to alias)
from data_loader import get_flowers_dataloaders
train_loader, val_loader, test_loader = get_flowers_dataloaders()

# New code (recommended)
from data_loader import get_plantvillage_dataloaders
train_loader, val_loader, test_loader = get_plantvillage_dataloaders()
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Dataset Not Found
```
FileNotFoundError: PlantVillage dataset not found
```
**Solution**: See [DATASET_SETUP.md](DATASET_SETUP.md)

### Issue: Low Accuracy
This is **expected** with 50 samples/class. Try:
- Increase `SAMPLES_PER_CLASS` to 100
- Increase `NUM_EPOCHS` to 100
- Try different learning rates

### Issue: Overfitting
Signs: High train accuracy, low val/test accuracy

Solutions:
- Reduce model capacity
- Increase regularization (weight decay)
- Use parameter-efficient methods (LoRA, BitFit)
- Enable data augmentation

## Project Context

This migration directly supports the project's research questions:

1. **How well do foundation models transfer to specialized domains?**
   → Measured by zero-shot accuracy gap

2. **What is the optimal fine-tuning strategy for low-data regimes?**
   → Compare LoRA, BitFit, Prefix vs. full fine-tuning

3. **What are the performance-efficiency trade-offs?**
   → Accuracy vs. trainable parameters analysis

4. **Can adapter methods match full fine-tuning with <1% parameters?**
   → Critical for agricultural deployment scenarios
